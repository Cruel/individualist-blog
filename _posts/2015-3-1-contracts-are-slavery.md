*Slavery* is one of those buzzwords that can be highjacked for nearly any political position, whether it be in the form of [tax slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_as_slavery) or [wage slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery) as used by libertarians and socialists respectively. This somewhat colorful use of the term *slavey* is perfectly acceptable, but it requires that you recognize a continuum of slavery that exists with "complete autonomy" on one end and "full restraint" on the other.

Many people complain about referencing anything in the middle of this continuum and calling it slavery because they prefer to exclusively refer to slavery as an institution of humans treated as absolute property. This leads to annoying evasive responses like "Did you *seriously* compare X to slavery?!" They only consider the "full restraint" end of the spectrum to be slavery while everything else is on a continuum of *voluntary association*. Or they take the only other alternative position which is to reject that any continuum exists and argue that any given human interaction must either be completely voluntary or completely coercive. I would direct anyone taking that position to my [Everything is Aggression](/everything-is-aggression/) post to learn how natural and social forces compel us constantly to make decisions independent of our will.

But in the long-term radical change is possible, so selling oneself into permanent slavery may be wrong in a similar way as selling another person into slavery, or at least too morally risky to allow.</p>

Still resisting the idea of the continuum, some people will say that slavery is unique because it does not permit people to lawfully escape their situation. Therefore something like "wage slavery" is a misnomer because anyone can clearly quit their waged position if they choose. But such an argument fails to realize that this *cost of exit* is indeed the main variable determining the position on the slavery continuum. And even slaves on the extreme end of the continumm, treated as absolute property, *are* able to escape, but the *cost of exit* is very high: typically their life. Now, the cost of quitting your job in a wage [slave] labor market is not nearly that high, but it clearly incurs *some* cost to your life and well-being. Complete autonomy and liberty (the other end on the continuum) would require that there is no cost, and therefore is no compulsion or coercion to *not* exit.

Assuming you have understood and agreed thusfar, you will probably agree with this generalized definition of *slavey*: *a system that enforces authority over or control of the actions of others.* The level of control, influenced by the *cost of exit*, is the variable that places you on the continuum. If there is no cost of exit, then there is no control over your actions, and you have complete liberty. If the cost of exit is unsurvivably high, then there is virtually full control over your actions and you find yourself on the other extreme end of the continuum. This extreme is where you find such things as serfdom, debt bondade, indentured servitude, child labor, and of course strict slavey (humans as property). All systems mentioned are officially considered types of slavery, and their varying levels of enslavement further demonstrate the existence of the *slavery continuum*. Such slavery situations are typically associated with an inability to reasonably expect survivability if subjects were to reject the authority over them, whether it be their lender, landlord, or slavemaster. There *are* of course some exceptions, especially among the debt bondade and child labor categories, where survivability is very possible.

When you agree to the terms of a contract, you are putting restrictions on your liberty, conscribing yourself to some level of slavery. Contracts are terms mutually agreed upon which have a violent enforcement mechanism, typically utilizing courts and police. Before making a labor contract, you have

Contract slavery is very desirable for those who want interdependence and collaboration. While contracts put restrictions on your individual liberty, they also unlock new liberties, at the expense of the people contracting with you. This method of mutual self-restriction provides reasonable guarantees for long-term interactions with other people, easing uncertainty and social tension. It is important to be critical of the ideals of self-sufficiency and independence that we fetishize and recognize that there are very good reasons human societies have turned toward [partial] dependence in the form of contract slavery &mdash; or *social slavery*.
