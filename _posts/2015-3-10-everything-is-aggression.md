*Aggression* typically means something different, something more specific, for libertarians than it does for the rest of the world:

> What ... aggressive violence means is that one man **invades the property of another** without the vicitm's consent.
<cite>Murray Rothbard</cite>

> "Aggression" is defined as the "initation" of physical force against persons or **property**, the threat of such, or fraud upon persons or their **property**.
<cite>Mises.org</cite>

As we can see, a definition of property often precludes libertarians' usage of the term *aggression*. This makes arguments leveraging "aggression" self-detonating when the discussion concerns property disagreement, and it often does. The arguments of "taxation is aggression" and "*not* paying taxes is aggression" are both true relative to your position on property.

It is important for libertarians to question the dogma of their terminology and expand their analysis of issues. The purpose of this post is to briefly contribute to the deeper analysis of aggression.

####What is voluntary?

To further complicate things, libertarians often claim that certain things, like employment, are voluntary as if it's a black and white issue. Essentially, anything that is absent of the threat of violence is considered voluntary. Yet ironically those same libertarians will claim that taxation is involuntary despite the fact that the force, or threat thereof, from failing to pay taxes can be avoided by merely leaving the country. Your decision to stay and be subject to taxes is *almost* as voluntary as a "wage slave" deciding to stay at their job despite poor working conditions (or whatever they may dislike about that job). Certainly leaving a nation is harder than leaving a job, and there are many more competing employers than competing nations. But would this imply that if there were simply *more* nations with more fluid borders that taxation would become voluntary?

No matter how far you decentralize the aggression, it never becomes completely voluntary. It simply becomes *more* voluntary.

####Are social influences voluntary?

Just because someone signs a contract (or says *yes*) doesn't mean a voluntary interaction has been made. We can clearly prove this point by pointing out cases of incapacitated (drunk, drugged, handicapped) individuals that agree to do things against their better judgment. In these situations, we would consider it aggression to compel them to both make these decision and abide by them. We don't consider these voluntary interactions because their decision-making process was/is negatively affected in some way, whether due to the ignorance of being a minor, forgetfulness of being elderly, or the hazy attentiveness of being intoxicated. Much like how a mugger's gun to their head unnecessarily narrows down their options, so too does incapacitation.

However, what if it isn't an intoxicant, handicap, or mugger that's influencing their decision process, but the culprit is instead social pressure? When someone asks you to have sex with them, are your actions completely voluntary, or are there potential consequences introduced that narrow your decisions down? Perhaps you think your friend/partner will leave you if you deny them, or maybe images of a Christian hellfire for fornicators crosses your mind, or maybe you're so extremely physically attracted to them that nothing else even crosses your mind at all. Are none of these conditions representative of an incapacitation?

Why is threatening with force the only means of making something involuntary? Why not threatening with taking away your friendship, threatening them with divine punishment, threatening them with legal action, threatening them with social ostracism? In the broader sense, how can we consider any decision completely voluntary unless there is a total absence of external influences pushing us to one side or the other? And if we are to accept these external influences that manipulate our decision-making ability, then how can *voluntaryism* provide a barometer for a morally acceptable interaction at all? I propose that we instead focus more on what should be considered acceptable methods to influence others. Saying something is "voluntary" is insufficient and ultimately not very true.

####Passive aggression of existence

Nobody voluntarily agreed to my existence except perhaps my parents. The resources I use, products I consume, air I breathe, space I occupy, nobody agreed to permit that beforehand. And when I make property claims, I'm forcible excluding them from using something with was previously open to their use, they never agreed to it.

When I'm stuck in traffic on the highway, the cars in front of me are *forcing me* to remain behind them. At best, I'm permitting them under the duress of negative socioeconomic consequences that would result from their inability to travel. But does this permission make the impact of other human beings less aggressive? Does my permission and forfeiture of my property to a mugger make their gun to my head less aggressive?

Everything can be considered aggression. So when your moral or legal standards are based around specific types of aggression, don't pretend like it's less arbitrary or more objective than anyone else's.
