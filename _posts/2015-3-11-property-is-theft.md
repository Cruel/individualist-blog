You are sitting in your home, minding your own business, when suddenly you hear a knock at your door. You answer it and find an IRS agent standing outside with some police officers. As any decent armed libertarian, you instinctively reach for your holstered gun to eradicate the statist scum, but stop yourself. You decide to hear what they have to say.

"We have a warrant for your arrest due to repeated failure to pay your income taxes," the IRS agent tells you. You expected as much. After all, you have refused to pay your state extortioners for a while now.

"No, you see, my income is my property. You are trying to steal from me. As a libertarian, I'm just trying to protect myself from aggression against me and my property." This probably won't work, but you hold your ground on principle.

They surprise you, "Great, we are libertarians too! You see, you have received a great number of services from us and have failed to compensate us. We are here to protect *our* property rights with legal action."

"I never asked for any of your services! I shouldn't have to pay."

"But your parents agreed to pay for those services. They gave birth to you and you continue to live here. It is implied that you agree to pay for these services. Otherwise you're free to leave to competing governments in the market."
