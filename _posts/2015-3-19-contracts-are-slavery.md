*Slavery* is one of those buzzwords that can be hijacked for nearly any political position, whether it be in the form of [tax slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_as_slavery) or [wage slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery) as used by libertarians and socialists respectively. This somewhat colorful use of the term *slavery* is perfectly acceptable, but it requires that you recognize a continuum of slavery that exists with "complete autonomy" on one end and "full restraint" on the other.

Many people complain about referencing anything in the middle of this continuum and calling it slavery because they prefer to exclusively refer to slavery as an institution of humans treated as absolute property. This leads to annoying evasive responses like "Did you *seriously* compare X to slavery?!" They only consider the "full restraint" end of the spectrum to be slavery while everything else is on a continuum of *voluntary association*. Or they take the only other alternative position which is to reject that any continuum exists and argue that any given human interaction must either be completely voluntary or completely coercive. I would direct anyone taking that position to my [Everything is Aggression](/everything-is-aggression/) post to learn how natural and social forces compel us constantly to make decisions independent of our will.

####Definition Troubles

Still resisting the idea of the continuum, some people will say that the term *slavery* is unique because it does not permit people to lawfully escape their situation. Therefore something like "wage slavery" is a misnomer because anyone can clearly quit their waged position if they choose. But such an argument fails to realize that this *cost of exit* is indeed the main variable determining the position on the slavery continuum. And even slaves on the extreme end of the continuum, treated as absolute property, *are* able to escape, but the *cost of exit* is very high: typically their life. Now, the cost of quitting your job in a wage [slave] labor market is not nearly that high, but it clearly incurs *some* cost to your life and well-being. Complete autonomy and liberty (the other end on the continuum) would require that there be no cost, and therefore be no compulsion or coercion to *not* exit.

Assuming you have understood and agreed thus far, you will probably agree with this generalized definition of *slavery*: *a system that enforces authority over or control of the actions of others.* The level of control, influenced by the *cost of exit*, is the variable that places you on the continuum. If there is no cost of exit, then there is no control over your actions, and you have complete liberty. If the cost of exit is unsurvivably high, then there is virtually full control over your actions and you find yourself on the other extreme end of the continuum. This extreme is where you find such things as serfdom, debt bondage, indentured servitude, child labor, and of course strict slavery (humans as property). All systems mentioned are officially considered types of slavery, and their varying levels of enslavement further demonstrate the existence of the *slavery continuum*. Such slavery situations are typically associated with an inability to reasonably expect survivability if subjects were to reject the authority over them, whether it be their lender, landlord, or slavemaster. There *are* of course some exceptions, especially among the debt bondage and child labor categories, where survivability is very possible.

####How do contracts fit in?

Libertarian scholars and writers like Robert Nozick and Walter Block are infamous when it comes to their defense of "voluntary slavery," that is, the consensual selling of oneself to another. This is typically considered acceptable under the concept of *self-ownership*, being that you own yourself and therefore have the right to transfer ownership. Many argue that the inalienability of the self makes that illegitimate. Regardless, slaves are never actually forfeiting their "self" as much as their indefinite obedience and labor. And considering how pretty much all labor contracts require a *definite* and delimited obedience and labor (*partial slavery*), it's not entirely clear why many libertarians oppose voluntary slavery. If it's acceptable to contract for a year's worth of my labor and conditional obedience, then why not a lifetime's worth? And why not unconditional obedience? Perhaps the best answer to these questions I found in a BHL post:

> Signing yourself up for a lifetime of permanent slavery seems too extreme to allow because your future self may be radically different from your present self ...
> <p>The crucial question is whether a decision that harms your future self is self-harming or other-harming. In the short term, it looks like we are close enough to our recent and nearby selves. But in the long-term radical change is possible, so selling oneself into permanent slavery may be wrong in a similar way as selling another person into slavery, or at least too morally risky to allow.</p>

However, when you agree to the terms of **any** bilateral contract, you are putting restrictions on your liberty, conscribing your future self to *some* level of slavery. This leads us to the [sorites paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox): when is your future self *different enough* from your current self to invalidate your contract? Instead of implementing a paternalistic broad-brush law to prohibit arbitrarily long-term contracts, I propose that we simply uphold a good standard of judicial discretion in our courts. If there is any reason to believe that there has been significant change in your understanding of your contract (i.e. your current self is *too* different from your past self that contracted), then there could be valid reasons for portions of the contract to not be enforced. As a beneficial side-effect, these precedents would compel contracting parties to make sure both parties understand the terms fully before making the legal commitment.

Contracts are terms mutually agreed upon which have a violent enforcement mechanism, typically utilizing courts and police. Libertarians often make the mistake of thinking that laws/contracts are absolute, in a vacuum. Contracts are only as good as the enforcement behind them. It doesn't matter how much your philosophical ideology demands that the terms of your contract be upheld, if a judge thinks the terms of your contract, or the consensual context, are inappropriate, they can decide to reject it. In a market, our responsibility would be to merely support judges who support the same level of contract slavery that we do. And in that regard, I would strongly criticize Walter Block for not opposing extreme slavery.

Contract slavery is very desirable for those who want interdependence and collaboration. While contracts put restrictions on your individual liberty, they also unlock new liberties, at the expense of the people contracting with you. This method of mutual self-restriction provides reasonable guarantees for long-term interactions with other people, easing uncertainty and social tension. It is important to be critical of the ideals of self-sufficiency and independence that we fetishize and recognize that there are very good reasons human societies have turned toward [partial] dependence in the form of contract slavery &mdash; or *social slavery*. We are hopelessly dependent on each other if we want a high standard of living.
