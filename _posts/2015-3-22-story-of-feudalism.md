You are sitting in your home, minding your own business, when suddenly you hear a knock at your door. You answer it and find an IRS agent standing outside with some police officers. As any decent armed libertarian, you instinctively reach for your holstered gun to eradicate the statist scum, but stop yourself. You decide to hear what they have to say.

"We have a warrant for your arrest due to repeated failure to pay your taxes," the IRS agent tells you. You expected as much. After all, you have refused to pay your state extortioners for a while now.

"No, you see, my income is my property. You are trying to steal from me. As a libertarian, I'm just trying to protect myself from aggression against me and my property." This probably won't work, but you hold your ground on principle.

They surprise you, "Great, we are libertarians too! You see, you have received a great number of services from us and have failed to compensate us. We are here to protect *our* property rights with legal action."

"I never asked for any of your services! I shouldn't have to pay."

"But your parents agreed to pay for those services. They gave birth to you and you continue to live here in our property/territory. It is implied that you agree to pay for these services. Otherwise you're free to leave and choose competing countries in the market."

####The Swap

Now reread the above story while replacing the IRS agent with a landlord, taxes with rent, and country with housing complex. Most libertarians will inconsistently side with the landlord while being completely against the IRS/government when they do the same thing.

If you feel the swapping of terms is unfair, here are the reasons it *isn't*:

1. **Upholding private property, both the landlord and the state are equally justified**. The landlord(s) own the housing complex and therefore have the right to charge any rent they want and make any rules they want for their tenets. The tenets who first moved to the housing complex agreed to a contract that permitted this. The state likewise owns the geographical region they govern and their first tenets (i.e. citizens, and our ancestors) agreed to the contract when they immigrated. Neither the state nor landlords necessarily followed any homesteading principles.

2. **Citizens no more own land than renters**. Landlords lend you some space and give you liberty to use it as you see fit (with some limitations). States do the same with their citizens. Citizens who are "property owners" only have that property with state permission and protection. The fact that a government won't call themselves a collective owner doesn't mean they effectively aren't.

3. **The size of the housing complex isn't relevant**. It could very well be a complex the size of states currently existing, or could be relatively small. All that matters for the comparison is that the large amount of land is considered acceptable property by society/law.

4. **The varying difficulty of leaving isn't relevant**. While having a bunch of decentralizing living facilities would give you *more* freedom and choice than a huge centralized state would, it still introduces a situation where people are coerced into paying *someone* in order to live. It's not voluntary association, it's merely *more* voluntary, it's holding a taser to your head instead of a gun.

My goal is to show how property claims are instruments of coercion. Nobody *voluntarily* agreed to property claims during initial acquisition, it was unilateral. This coercion merely shrinks when property claims are smaller, it never goes away. And all subsequent property transfers in a society do not justify or invalidate this coercion. You do not have a right to property outside of a society that recognizes the right. This doesn't mean I'm against property, it means I recognize that *some* coercion is acceptable.
