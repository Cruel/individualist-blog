Murray Rothbard “Aggression” is defined as the “initation” of physical force against persons or property , the threat of such, or fraud upon persons or their property . Mises.org As we can see, a definition of property often precludes libertarians’ usage of the term aggression . This makes arguments leveraging “aggression” self-detonating when the discussion concerns property disagreement, and it often does. The arguments of “taxation is aggression” and “ not paying taxes is aggression” are both true relative to your position on property. It is important for libertarians to question the dogma of their terminology and expand their analysis of issues. The purpose of this post is to briefly contribute to the deeper analysis of aggression. What is voluntary? To further complicate things, libertarians often claim that certain things, like employment, are voluntary as if it’s a black and white issue. Essentially, anything that is absent of the threat of violence is considered voluntary. Yet ironically those same libertarians will claim that taxation is involuntary despite the fact that the force, or threat thereof, from failing to pay taxes can be avoided by merely leaving the country. Your decision to stay and be subject to taxes is almost as voluntary as a “wage slave” deciding to stay at their job despite poor working conditions (or whatever they may dislike about that job). Certainly leaving a nation is harder than leaving a job, and there are many more competing employers than competing nations. But would this imply that if there were simply more nations with more fluid borders that taxation would become voluntary? No matter how far you decentralize the aggression, it never becomes completely voluntary. It simply becomes more voluntary. Are social influences voluntary? Just because someone signs a contract (or says yes ) doesn’t mean a voluntary interaction has been made. We can clearly prove this point by pointing out cases of incapacitated (drunk, drugged, handicapped) individuals that agree to do things against their better judgment. In these situations, we would consider it aggression to compel them to both make these decision and abide by them. We don’t consider these voluntary interactions because their decision-making process was/is negatively affected in some way, whether due to the ignorance of being a minor, forgetfulness of being elderly, or the hazy attentiveness of being intoxicated. Much like how a mugger’s gun to their head unnecessarily narrows down their options, so too does incapacitation. However, what if it isn’t an intoxicant, handicap, or mugger that’s influencing their decision process, but the culprit is instead social pressure? When someone asks you to have sex with them, are your actions completely voluntary, or are there potential consequences introduced that narrow your decisions down? Perhaps you think your friend/partner will leave you if you deny them, or maybe images of a Christian hellfire for fornicators crosses your mind, or maybe you’re so extremely physically attracted to them that nothing else even crosses your mind at all. Are none of these conditions representative of an incapacitation? Why is threatening with force the only means of making something involuntary? Why not threatening with taking away your friendship, threatening them with divine punishment, threatening them with legal action, threatening them with social ostracism? In the broader sense, how can we consider any decision completely voluntary unless there is a total absence of external influences pushing us to one side or the other? And if we are to accept these external influences that manipulate our decision-making ability, then how can voluntaryism provide a barometer for a morally acceptable interaction at all? I propose that we instead focus more on what should be considered acceptable methods to influence others. Saying something is “voluntary” is insufficient and ultimately not very true. Passive aggression of existence Nobody voluntarily agreed to my existence except perhaps my parents. The resources I use, products I consume, air I breathe, space I occupy, nobody agreed to permit that beforehand. And when I make property claims, I’m forcible excluding them from using something with was previously open to their use, they never agreed to it. When I’m stuck in traffic on the highway, the cars in front of me are forcing me to remain behind them. At best, I’m permitting them under the duress of negative socioeconomic consequences that would result from their inability to travel. But does this permission make the impact of other human beings less aggressive? Does my permission and forfeiture of my property to a mugger make their gun to my head less aggressive? Everything can be considered aggression. So when your moral or legal standards are based around specific types of aggression, don’t pretend like it’s less arbitrary or more objective than anyone else’s. "},{"title":"Contracts are Slavery","url":"/contracts-are-slavery/","date":"2015-03-19 00:00:00 -0400","categories":[],"body":" Slavery is one of those buzzwords that can be hijacked for nearly any political position, whether it be in the form of tax slavery or wage slavery as used by libertarians and socialists respectively. This somewhat colorful use of the term slavery is perfectly acceptable, but it requires that you recognize a continuum of slavery that exists with “complete autonomy” on one end and “full restraint” on the other. Many people complain about referencing anything in the middle of this continuum and calling it slavery because they prefer to exclusively refer to slavery as an institution of humans treated as absolute property. This leads to annoying evasive responses like “Did you seriously compare X to slavery?!” They only consider the “full restraint” end of the spectrum to be slavery while everything else is on a continuum of voluntary association . Or they take the only other alternative position which is to reject that any continuum exists and argue that any given human interaction must either be completely voluntary or completely coercive. I would direct anyone taking that position to my Everything is Aggression post to learn how natural and social forces compel us constantly to make decisions independent of our will. Definition Troubles Still resisting the idea of the continuum, some people will say that the term slavery is unique because it does not permit people to lawfully escape their situation. Therefore something like “wage slavery” is a misnomer because anyone can clearly quit their waged position if they choose. But such an argument fails to realize that this cost of exit is indeed the main variable determining the position on the slavery continuum. And even slaves on the extreme end of the continuum, treated as absolute property, are able to escape, but the cost of exit is very high: typically their life. Now, the cost of quitting your job in a wage [slave] labor market is not nearly that high, but it clearly incurs some cost to your life and well-being. Complete autonomy and liberty (the other end on the continuum) would require that there be no cost, and therefore be no compulsion or coercion to not exit. The labeled proportions may not be accurate, but it illustrates a common failure to recognize coercive (enslaving) forces beyond the government. Assuming you have understood and agreed thus far, you will probably agree with this generalized definition of slavery : a system that enforces authority over or control of the actions of others. The level of control, influenced by the cost of exit , is the variable that places you on the continuum. If there is no cost of exit, then there is no control over your actions, and you have complete liberty. If the cost of exit is unsurvivably high, then there is virtually full control over your actions and you find yourself on the other extreme end of the continuum. This extreme is where you find such things as serfdom, debt bondage, indentured servitude, child labor, and of course strict slavery (humans as property). All systems mentioned are officially considered types of slavery, and their varying levels of enslavement further demonstrate the existence of the slavery continuum . Such slavery situations are typically associated with an inability to reasonably expect survivability if subjects were to reject the authority over them, whether it be their lender, landlord, or slavemaster. There are of course some exceptions, especially among the debt bondage and child labor categories, where survivability is very possible. How do contracts fit in? Libertarian scholars and writers like Robert Nozick and Walter Block are infamous when it comes to their defense of “voluntary slavery,” that is, the consensual selling of oneself to another. This is typically considered acceptable under the concept of self-ownership , being that you own yourself and therefore have the right to transfer ownership. Many argue that the inalienability of the self makes that illegitimate. Regardless, slaves are never actually forfeiting their “self” as much as their indefinite obedience and labor. And considering how pretty much all labor contracts require a definite and delimited obedience and labor ( partial slavery ), it’s not entirely clear why many libertarians oppose voluntary slavery. If it’s acceptable to contract for a year’s worth of my labor and conditional obedience, then why not a lifetime’s worth? And why not unconditional obedience? Perhaps the best answer to these questions I found in a BHL post: Signing yourself up for a lifetime of permanent slavery seems too extreme to allow because your future self may be radically different from your present self … The crucial question is whether a decision that harms your future self is self-harming or other-harming. In the short term, it looks like we are close enough to our recent and nearby selves. But in the long-term radical change is possible, so selling oneself into permanent slavery may be wrong in a similar way as selling another person into slavery, or at least too morally risky to allow. Jessica Flanigan However, when you agree to the terms of any bilateral contract, you are putting restrictions on your liberty, conscribing your future self to some level of slavery. This leads us to the sorites paradox : when is your future self different enough from your current self to invalidate your contract? Instead of implementing a paternalistic broad-brush law to prohibit arbitrarily long-term contracts, I propose that we simply uphold a good standard of judicial discretion in our courts. If there is any reason to believe that there has been significant change in your understanding of your contract (i.e. your current self is too different from your past self that contracted), then there could be valid reasons for portions of the contract to not be enforced. As a beneficial side-effect, these precedents would compel contracting parties to make sure both parties understand the terms fully before making the legal commitment. Contracts are terms mutually agreed upon which have a violent enforcement mechanism, typically utilizing courts and police. Libertarians often make the mistake of thinking that laws/contracts are absolute, in a vacuum. Contracts are only as good as the enforcement behind them. It doesn’t matter how much your philosophical ideology demands that the terms of your contract be upheld, if a judge thinks the terms of your contract, or the consensual context, are inappropriate, they can decide to reject it. In a market, our responsibility would be to merely support judges who support the same level of contract slavery that we do. And in that regard, I would strongly criticize Walter Block for not opposing extreme slavery. Contract slavery is very desirable for those who want interdependence and collaboration. While contracts put restrictions on your individual liberty, they also unlock new liberties, at the expense of the people contracting with you. This method of mutual self-restriction provides reasonable guarantees for long-term interactions with other people, easing uncertainty and social tension. It is important to be critical of the ideals of self-sufficiency and independence that we fetishize and recognize that there are very good reasons human societies have turned toward [partial] dependence in the form of contract slavery — or social slavery . We are hopelessly dependent on each other if we want a high standard of living.

You answer it and find an IRS agent standing outside with some police officers. As any decent armed libertarian, you instinctively reach for your holstered gun to eradicate the statist scum, but stop yourself. You decide to hear what they have to say. “We have a warrant for your arrest due to repeated failure to pay your taxes,” the IRS agent tells you. You expected as much. After all, you have refused to pay your state extortioners for a while now. “No, you see, my income is my property. You are trying to steal from me. As a libertarian, I’m just trying to protect myself from aggression against me and my property.” This probably won’t work, but you hold your ground on principle. They surprise you, “Great, we are libertarians too! You see, you have received a great number of services from us and have failed to compensate us. We are here to protect our property rights with legal action.” “I never asked for any of your services! I shouldn’t have to pay.” “But your parents agreed to pay for those services. They gave birth to you and you continue to live here in our property/territory. It is implied that you agree to pay for these services. Otherwise you’re free to leave and choose competing countries in the market.” The Swap Now reread the above story while replacing the IRS agent with a landlord, taxes with rent, and country with housing complex. Most libertarians will inconsistently side with the landlord while being completely against the IRS/government when they do the same thing. If you feel the swapping of terms is unfair, here are the reasons it isn’t : Upholding private property, both the landlord and the state are equally justified . The landlord(s) own the housing complex and therefore have the right to charge any rent they want and make any rules they want for their tenets. The tenets who first moved to the housing complex agreed to a contract that permitted this. The state likewise owns the geographical region they govern and their first tenets (i.e. citizens, and our ancestors) agreed to the contract when they immigrated. Neither the state nor landlords necessarily followed any homesteading principles. Citizens no more own land than renters . Landlords lend you some space and give you liberty to use it as you see fit (with some limitations). States do the same with their citizens. Citizens who are “property owners” only have that property with state permission and protection. The fact that a government won’t call themselves a collective owner doesn’t mean they effectively aren’t. The size of the housing complex isn’t relevant . It could very well be a complex the size of states currently existing, or could be relatively small. All that matters for the comparison is that the large amount of land is considered acceptable property by society/law. The varying difficulty of leaving isn’t relevant . While having a bunch of decentralizing living facilities would give you more freedom and choice than a huge centralized state would, it still introduces a situation where people are coerced into paying someone in order to live. It’s not voluntary association, it’s merely more voluntary, it’s holding a taser to your head instead of a gun. My goal is to show how property claims are instruments of coercion. Nobody voluntarily agreed to property claims during initial acquisition, it was unilateral. This coercion merely shrinks when property claims are smaller, it never goes away. And all subsequent property transfers in a society do not justify or invalidate this coercion. You do not have a right to property outside of a society that recognizes the right. This doesn’t mean I’m against property, it means I recognize that some coercion is acceptable. "}]}
